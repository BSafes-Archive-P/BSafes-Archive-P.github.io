## 6. CONCLUSION
Education is a continual process for a person's whole growth (Banerjee and Singh, 2020). The study shows that learners need a personalized platform and tools during this pandemic situation. In this number, a number of students were left from schools and colleges (Mohammed, Rida and Chafiq, 2021). In the whole world, people are facing many problems after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, teaching-learning platforms rapidly changed from offline to online classrooms (Banerjee and Singh, 2020). For the first time, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an increased use of online learning on a global scale (Chatterjee and Chakraborty, 2020; Skulmowski and Rey, 2020). During the COVID 19 period, the study's goal was to investigate the online learning platforms and tools on students' perceptions of online learning. The study's descriptive research method was appropriate for achieving this purpose. On the other hand, this crisis has encouraged innovation in the education sector. From radio and television to take-home packages, we've seen creative techniques to ensure education and training continuity. Governments and all partners across the world, particularly the Global Education Coalition organized by UNESCO, responded quickly to support education sustainability, resulting in the development of online learning alternatives. The study is also aware of the critical role of teachers, as well as the enduring responsibility that governments and other relevant stakeholders have for education workers.
