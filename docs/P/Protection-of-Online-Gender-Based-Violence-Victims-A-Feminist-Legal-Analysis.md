## Abstract
*The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in cases of online gender-based violence (OGBV). However, this issue has not yet received attention in the realm of Indonesian law, especially when it comes to protecting the rights of the victims. This paper examines how the current legal framework in Indonesia handles OGBV cases and whether it is sufficient to provide protection for victims. Through the elaboration of several examples of cases that are widely discussed in Indonesian society, this paper will show how the legal process following OGBV is often detrimental to women. There is a correlation between the strong patriarchal culture; and the lack of understanding by the community and law enforcement officers on the concept of consent. This corners women as victims of OGBV leading to the secondary victimization process. The research applied a feminist legal method that focuses on the experiences of women as OGBV victims and hopes to contribute to the formulation of a legal umbrella and legal system with a more victim perspective in Indonesia.*
