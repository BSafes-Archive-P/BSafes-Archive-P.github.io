## 3. METHODOLOGY
During the continuing lockdown, the Ministry of Education has also maintained online learning platforms and tools across the country for accessing online educational resources. Online learning platforms related information was obtained from different countries by visiting UNESCO websites. Data for the study was collected during July 2021 from the website of UNESCO (https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse/nationalresponses). Through data mining was done from the raw data with the use of tables for enhanced visualization. The study was categorized systematically by country-wise online learning platforms under UNESCO. The information gathered is evaluated in order to determine the platforms and languages used by the online learning system during lockdown and to recommend changes considered vital to make it more successful for learners.
