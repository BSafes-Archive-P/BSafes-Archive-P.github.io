## Shrinking Big Data
Researchers exploring the antecedent behavior of public mass killers <sup>47</sup> and intimate partner homicide offenders <sup>48</sup> have identified numerous indicators of online threatening behavior that typically precede these violent crimes including expressing homicidal thoughts, acquiring weapons, articulating specific plans, and engaging in surveillance and cyberstalking of intended victims via social media. It

appears that law enforcement agencies should be able to prevent or disrupt a substantial number of violent crimes like lone actor killings, stranger-perpetrated homicides, and intimate partner homicides by leveraging online behavioral threat indicators, but the sheer magnitude of data that individuals produce and share on social media makes this seem like a herculean challenge. Fortunately, there are many nascent big data strategies and systems that have tremendous potential as tools for strategic and tactical criminal intelligence, and these tools often have cross-functional capabilities across different types of crisis situations like preventing mass killings and allocating resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup>49</sup> Crowdsourcing data, the practice of engaging with a community as valued partners and teaching interested citizens about online behavioral threat indicators that should be shared with law enforcement, can be an effective and flexible strategy for expanding limited resources, maintaining police transparency, and building trusting relationships.<sup>50</sup> The value of crowdsourcing is supported by specific online behaviors that have been reported to law enforcement prior to successful mass shooting attacks including website evidence that the 1999 Columbine School shooters made specific advance threats and purchased weapons, and email evidence revealing that the 2009 Fort Hood Army Base shooter was communicating with extremists and might be planning a “heroic” suicide attack.<sup>51</sup>

While crowdsourcing is certainly a useful resource, it does not allow law enforcement to proactively search for specific behavioral indicators, and a more targeted instrument would be better suited for guiding decisions about surveillance and resource allocation. Social media data mining techniques like link analysis and sentiment analysis can equip law enforcement to actively search for specific types of information and even to analyze and classify the sources of that information.<sup>52</sup> Link analysis uses specialized types of search algorithms to explore interconnected links and map related content, while sentiment analysis uses machine-learning methods to identify peoples’ attitudes or opinions about particular topics and to evaluate the relative strength and positive or negative quality of those opinions.<sup>53</sup> Social media link analysis can be a particularly powerful tool toward the prevention, disruption, and prosecution of crimes like domestic terror, gang violence, and mass killing because it can be used to map social networks and to chart threatening behavioral indicators like frequenting extremist or violent fetishist websites, and liking or sharing memes that represent fascination with or incitement

to commit violent crimes. This information can be strengthened by sentiment analysis designed to expose online behavior patterns that reflect threatening attitudes like misogyny, depersonalization of outgroup members, glorification of violence, and strong positive sentiments about lawlessness and chaos.
