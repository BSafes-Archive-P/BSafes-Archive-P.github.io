## 2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Khan et al. (2021) study reveals that a quantitative approach was used, and responses from 184 university students from Delhi University, Jamia Millia Islamia (Central University), and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India, were collected via an online questionnaire. This research study took place between June and August of 2020. The study's findings reveal students' good perceptions of e-learning and their adoption of this new learning system are revealed by the study's findings. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, it has also empirically proved the relevance of e-learning. The study's findings will help educational institutions and policymakers take online learning to the next level in a more effective way. Similarly, Pokhrel and Chhetri (2021) present a complete assessment of the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on online teaching and learning of various papers, as well as suggest a course of action. Another study observed was to find out what issues and barriers English language learners (EFL) at Science and Arts College, Alula, Taibah University, Saudi Arabia, face as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic in the second semester of 2020. The purpose of this study is to investigate the viability of virtual learning methods by evaluating learners' new experiences in online education. This was accomplished by examining the responses of 184 students to a survey-based inquiry. The study's validity was assessed using a descriptive statistical method. According to the findings, the key issues that influence and affect online EFL learning during COVID-19 are connected to technological, academic, and communication concerns. The survey shows that the majority of EFL students are dissatisfied with their online learning since they have not made the desired progress in language learning, Mahyoob (2020). Further study shows that online learning during Covid-19. This article focuses on the benefits of online learning during times of crisis, such as job absences or pandemics. As a result, various online learning tools and strategies that can assure learning continuity are emphasized. The government of India’s new methods for online learning was discussed. There is also a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of using online learning platforms. During lockdown, learners' and instructors' impressions of the online learning system were discussed, Jena (2020).

Coman et al (2020) Researchers examined students' attitudes towards online learning, their ability to absorb information, and their use of e-learning platforms in this regard. A semistructured questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey. 762 students from two of Romania's largest institutions participated in the study. The findings of the study revealed that Romanian higher education institutions were not prepared for solely online learning. As a result, the benefits of online learning documented in previous studies appear to be diminishing, while the negatives become more obvious. In the context of the pandemic-induced crisis, the hierarchy of difficulties that develop in online learning shifts. The most prominent concerns are technological issues, followed by teachers' lack of technical abilities and badly suited instructional styles for the online setting. Students, on the other hand, attributed the last place to a lack of connection with professors or poor communication with them. The research implications for institutions and researchers are examined in light of these findings. Similarly, Banerjee and Singh (2020) said that they would assess students' reactions to shifting teaching and learning platforms during the COVID lockdown and compare them to the resp19 pandemic act, which is based on gender and location. A total of 275 undergraduate and graduate students from five universities participated in the study. Most students have a neutral attitude toward teaching and the learning process, according to the findings, while a few students have a favorable attitude toward teaching. During lockdown, the learning process is also discovered. In general, students are interested in their studies in light of the changing situation, although many are dissatisfied with their learning progress during lockdown. According to the findings, there is no substantial variation in students' perceptions of teaching under lockdown based on gender or location.
