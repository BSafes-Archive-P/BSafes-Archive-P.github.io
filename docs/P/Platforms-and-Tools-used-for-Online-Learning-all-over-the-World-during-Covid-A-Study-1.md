## 1. INTRODUCTION
According to the UNESCO motto in all countries, "education for all," global online education describes not only a technological advance in access to useful information for people in developing countries, but also a massive change away from education as a means of perpetuating the upper class (McCarty, Ibrahim, Sedunov, and Sharma, 2006). When it comes to improving the educational process, the present state of information technology provides new methods and tools to consider. Among these methods and tools, online learning platforms are now used at different phases of organizational learning systems (Dodun et al., 2015). More organizations are recognizing the value of online learning because it is a cost-effective way to attract the majority of individuals. It has the opportunity to generate impressive results by not only reducing costs but also enhancing the organization (Jena, 2020). Many educational activities have been forced to stop due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Because of this, educational institutions have no choice but to transition to online learning (Heng and Sol, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has caused chaos and destruction, including almost every part of human life. COVID-19 has resulted in the temporary shutdown of educational institutions all around the world. School and university cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted more than 1.5 billion students and learners around the world (UNESCO). Several countries are affected globally, and there is concern that the current year, as well as future years, may be lost (Dhawan, 2020). Over 175 members of the United Nations family, civilized society, education, and the commercial sector join together to assure that "Learning Never Stops" (UNESCO).

Covid-19 has placed countries all over the world on lockdown and educational institutions are the same everywhere. The country is experiencing a severe problem in several areas as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak across the country, but the educational system has been affected the worst, with most courses being delayed during final exams. Learners are challenged to get an internet service that is both reliable and consistent. After this unanticipated crisis, the government has to maintain the right to education. To overcome this crisis, the Ministry of Education has maintained online learning platforms and tools for accessing online educational resources across the country. In this article, we attempt to examine different platforms and tools for online learning during this pandemic situation. In such a situation, these learning platforms may be of tremendous support because they are provided in an online format, are easily accessible, and are available for free.
